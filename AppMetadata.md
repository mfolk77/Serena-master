## App Store Review Notes

**For Apple Review Team:**

SerenaNet is a productivity-focused AI assistant that differentiates itself through:

1. **Local Processing:** All AI computation happens on-device using local models, not generic cloud APIs
2. **Privacy Focus:** No data transmission, comprehensive encryption, transparent privacy practices
3. **Specific Use Case:** Designed for users who need AI assistance while maintaining data privacy
4. **Native Integration:** Built specifically for macOS with proper system integration

The app does not rely on generic AI chat services but implements its own local AI processing pipeline. This provides clear value beyond simple chat interfaces by ensuring complete user privacy and offline functionality.

**Test Account:** Not required (no server-side components)
**Demo Instructions:** 
1. Launch app and complete onboarding
2. Try text conversation with sample questions
3. Test voice input feature (requires microphone permission)
4. Explore settings and privacy options
5. Create multiple conversations to test organization features

**Special Considerations:**
- App requires significant RAM for AI model (4GB recommended)
- First launch may take longer due to model initialization
- Voice input requires microphone permission but works offline
- All data stays local - no network connectivity required for core functionality
