This file records the current state of the Serena virtual assistant project, including architecture, memory, skills, nodes, and test status as of 2024-06-09.
---

@architecture
- Modular Swift orchestrator (library + executable)
- Node/Skill protocol pattern
- Persistent memory (episodic.store, semantic.store)
- Logging to logs/dev_log.ftai
- FTAI-based project state database
@end

@files
- orchestrator.swift: Orchestrator, protocols, logger
- OrchestratorMemory.swift: Episodic memory I/O
- HelloSkill.swift: Demo skill
- HelloNode.swift: Demo node
- main.swift: Test harness (in orchestratorApp)
- Package.swift: Library + executable targets
- project_state.ftai: Project state database (this file)
@end

@memory
- episodic: ../../memory/episodic.store (appends input/output pairs)
- semantic: ../../memory/semantic.store (reserved for future use)
- project_db: ../../memory/project_state.ftai (project snapshot)
@end

@skills
- HelloSkill: returns greeting with input ("Hello, world! You said: ...")
@end

@nodes
- HelloNode: routes input to HelloSkill
@end

@logs
- All major events and memory writes are logged to logs/dev_log.ftai using @log_event tags
@end

@status
- Orchestrator compiles and runs
- Node/Skill pattern proven
- Memory stub working (episodic)
- Test harness output: "Hello, world! You said: Test input from PM"
- Project structure and state are now persistently tracked in FTAI format
@end

@next_steps
- Expand memory features (semantic, clearing, advanced logging)
- Add more skills/nodes
- Build CLI or UI interface
- Integrate security and policy modules
@end
